#### Vision Statement
Every product needs some kind of vision.  A great example from the early days (70s) of Microsoft:
"A personal computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft Software"
From 08 Github: "Git hosting, now slightly less terrible." -> "It's better to work together than alone" (Is this grammatically in-line with what they are trying to say...)
try github.zen
