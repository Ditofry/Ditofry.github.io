## Dynamic Programming
**Note: dynamic programming is not the same as a [dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)**

Dynamic programming(DP) is an algorithm technique for solving problems which contain overlapping sub-problems or which would otherwise involve repeating work in order to solve with a different algorithm approach. Before going over examples of problems that warrant a DP solution it would be good to focus on a key concept that DP relies on: [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).
