[Semantic basically means "meaning"][webster-semantics], and is typically concerned
with traditional written and spoken language, although it also pertains to symbols,
meta-languages (e.g. programming languages), and any other imaginable form of
communication that involves articulating an idea for the purpose of communicating
that idea to another person.  Our physical means of communication need to have semantic value,
or "meaning", in order to be effective. For example, the semantic value of "Water" is
approximately "a clear liquid that humans require to live, chemically identified as H2O".
Setting aside the complicated reality that our communication is ever-changing and wildly
complex, everybody who speaks english roughly agrees on the semantics of very common objects
and ideas such as water, even when those semantics change based on context:
"your hipster swill is not beer, it's water".

It has been a life-pursuit for many a philosopher and linguist to tackle subsets
of the study of Semantics: what the semantics for certain concepts should be,
what problems arise from semantic complexity of ordinary language, where or whether
at all perfect semantics can be achieved, and so on.  As such I'm not going to
get into the weeds with semantics the way that a Linguist or Philosopher of Language
would.  I just want to make the point that while semantics can be used in a way
that is obstructive to the goal of understanding something, (e.g. a politician
who uses ambiguous semantics to imply something that is more palatable than
the actual truth).

Semantics can be tricky, prone to misuse, and knowingly abused, which is exactly why
it's necessary to spend at least some time formalizing them in order to make
progress in any discipline.  If I, as a pretend chemist, say "Hey fellow. chemist,
that sealed potion (I did say pretend) on the lab table there is extremely
volatile and reacts with oxygen.", it's important that the/any other chemist will
know what volatile and oxygen mean, and will hopefully not blow anything up by
opening it in a regular oxygen-filled atmosphere.  More specifically, since many
of the people reading this blog are more likely to be programmers, if I say
"the epsilon symbol belongs in the meta language, not in the object language",
then those of you who are nerds about the academic side of Programming Language
formation will know exactly how to interpret that sentence without risking mis-communication
and without needing extra time to get on the same page as to what that sentence
means, which is especially important in collaborative work environments, and these
days almost everything is a collaborative work environment.

It can be exhaustive and boring to toil on crafting and memorizing the
meanings of terms as they relate to particular fields of study, but it's important,
because without a proper grasp of your discipline's semantics you will,
at some point, misinterpret what is going on and end up doing more or less work
than you need to. And your emails are probably going to be really bad, too.

So next time you ask your co-workers to stop for a moment so that everyone can
agree on the explicit meaning of a certain word or phrase, even if the case is as simple
as the contextual meaning of "up", and they get dismissive and hand-wavy about
the issue being "just semantics", point out that you or they may be falsely
attributing meaning to the word or phrase in question, or that they may be rejecting
the meaning that you or others have taken in favor of their own, and be stout in
your resolution to find a common understanding in order to prevent miscommunication
over that word in the future.
