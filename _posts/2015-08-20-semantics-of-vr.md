Mostly a quick reference for talking about Virtual Reality in my other posts that
I will continue to add to as necessary.

The terminology that I use comes from the [writings][mel-writings] of
[Mel Slater][mel], a leading researcher in the field of virtual reality, and is
used in publications elsewhere by other researchers as well.

 * (PI) Place Illusion: "...the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place."<p class="citation">Slater, Mel [Place Illusion and Plausibility Can Lead to Realistic Behaviour in Immersive Virtual Environments][pl_psi_article], 2009</p>
 * (PSI) Plausibility Illusion: "...the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring."<p class="citation">Slater, Mel [Place Illusion and Plausibility Can Lead to Realistic Behaviour in Immersive Virtual Environments][pl_psi_article], 2009</p>
 * (RAIR) Response As If Real: Mostly self-explanatory.  Examples would be involuntarily flinching or blocking when something in a VR environment is thrown at you.
