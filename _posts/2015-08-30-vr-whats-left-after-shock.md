Many people have been exposed to the recent Virtual Reality renaissance mostly through
short videos and gifs that feature someone wearing a VR headset for a few
seconds before freaking out and trying to physically resist the virtual thrills or
horrors that they're being subjected to in the virtual world. Exhibit A:

![guy falling out of chair on virtual roller coaster](/assets/vr-coaster.gif "V.R. coaster fail")

The nets cast by aggregators and social media are reeling in a lot of people screaming as
they summit the peaks of impossibly tall roller coasters, people swatting at aggressive swarms
of insects, people trying to physically resist the onslaught of virtual monsters,
and so on.
